            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p> Hello, My name is Vannes you can call me nes. <br>
                Im 20 years old now and im still doing my college at Telkom University Bandung.<br>
                I've been interested to become Front End web or UI Designer from Senior High School
                <br>
                <br>
                In my opinion, in today's era technology is very influential and widely accessed by many people, 
                therefore I chose the field that I like in the field of technology around websites, 
                with websites I learn how to fill in information that can be accessed by many people, 
                not only that it turns out that the website requires a good design to support it. 
                I was increasingly attracted by this challenge, so I started my career in front end and ui/ux design positions to solidify my basic understanding of web development.
                After that, I will continue my career as a fullstack web development. 
                I hope I can run it well and full of joy
            </p>
